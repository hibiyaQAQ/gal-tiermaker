# TierMaker Project

This is a simple web application that allows users to create tier lists by uploading images and dragging them into customizable tiers.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tiers**: Add, remove, rename, and reorder tiers.
- **Customizable Tier Labels**: Change the color of tier labels.
- **Image Upload**: Upload images from your local computer to an image pool.
- **Drag and Drop**: Easily drag images from the pool to tiers, between tiers, or back to the pool.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Your tier list configuration and image placements are saved in your browser's local storage, so your work persists across sessions.

## How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  **Add Tiers**: Click the "æ·»åŠ çº§åˆ«" (Add Tier) button to create new tiers. Initially, some default tiers (A, A-, B+, B, C) are created.
3.  **Manage Tiers**:
    - Click on a tier label to rename it.
    - Use the arrow buttons (â–²/â–¼) next to each tier to move it up or down.
    - Use the palette button (ðŸŽ¨) to change the tier label's background color.
    - Use the cross button (âœ•) to delete a tier. Images in a deleted tier will be moved back to the image pool.
4.  **Upload Images**: Click the "ä¸Šä¼ å›¾ç‰‡" (Upload Images) button to select image files from your computer. Uploaded images will appear in the "å›ºå®šå›¾ç‰‡" (Pinned Images) section at the bottom.
5.  **Rank Images**: Drag images from the "å›ºå®šå›¾ç‰‡" pool and drop them into your desired tiers.
    - You can also drag images between different tiers or drag an image from a tier back to the image pool.
